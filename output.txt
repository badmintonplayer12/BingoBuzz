/*
  Naming convention:

  If a variable is used for a specific component: --{component}-{property name}-{modifier}

  Both {component} and {property name} should be kebab-case. If the target is the entire page,
  use 'report' for the component. The property name should not be abbreviated. Use the
  property name the variable is intended for - if it's used for multiple, a common descriptor
  is fine (ex: 'size' for a variable applied to 'width' and 'height'). If a variable is shared
  across multiple components, either create more variables or just drop the "{component}-"
  part of the name. Append any modifiers at the end (ex: 'big', 'dark').

  For colors: --color-{hue}-{intensity}

  {intensity} is the Material Design tag - 700, A700, etc.

    * We don't want table headers ("Est Savings (ms)") to wrap or their column values, but
      we'd be happy for the URL column to wrap if the URLs are particularly long.
    * We want the narrow columns to remain narrow, providing the most column width for URL
    * We don't want the table to extend past 100% width.
    * Long URLs in the URL column can wrap. Util.getURLDisplayName maxes them out at 64 characters,
      but they do not get any overflow:ellipsis treatment.

## Folder layout
- Base directory: `assets/sounds/bingobuzz/`
- Licensed pack (current): `assets/sounds/bingobuzz/NonCommerseLicense/`
- Manifest: `assets/sounds/bingobuzz/manifest.json`

## Steps to add new files
1. **Copy files** into `assets/sounds/bingobuzz/NonCommerseLicense/`.
2. **Normalize filenames** by running the rename script:
   ```
   node scripts/rename-sounds.mjs
   ```
   This enforces:
   - Spaces → `_`
   - Removes unsupported characters
   - Keeps uppercase letters
   - Lowercases extensions
3. **Update `manifest.json`**:
   - Each entry needs: `id`, `src`, `display`, `category`, `gain`, `etag`.
   - `id/src` should match the normalized filename (without extension).
   - `display` is the human-friendly label (keep spaces/special chars here).
   - `category` must be one of existing groups (e.g., `voice`, `jingle`, `music`).
   - `etag` equals the original filename/version identifier for cache busting.
4. **Verify** in browser:
   - Run the app, open the library panel, check the new entries appear with correct display names.
   - Play each new clip once to ensure no decoding errors.

## Script details
- `scripts/rename-sounds.mjs` scans `NonCommerseLicense/` and renames files to safe slugs.
- Only affects files whose names change; re-run whenever new audio is added.
- After renaming, update `manifest.json` accordingly.

## Notes for AI agents
- Never commit raw files with spaces or special characters—always run the script.
- Preserve original capitalization when constructing `display`.
- Keep existing ordering in `manifest.json` unless asked otherwise.
-eigende tests (Vitest) should be run after manifest changes: `npm test`.

# Implementation Plan: Library, Favorites, and Playlist Regeneration

## 1. Library / Settings Panel
- Add hidden panel (hotspot, long-press, keyboard `L`) with modal behavior.
- Panel uses `role="dialog" aria-modal="true"`, handles ESC/click-outside/close button.
- Render manifest list with columns: title/id, category, preview button, favorite toggle.
- Provide filter (“vis bare favoritter”) and summary (“N favoritter av M spor”).
- Preview audio via audio-engine in preview mode; stop preview when main play button is used.

## 2. Favorites Storage & UI
- Persist favorites in `localStorage` (`bbz:v1:favorites`); add helpers `loadFavorites`/`saveFavorites`.
- Remove invalid IDs when manifest changes; show hint if storage unavailable.
- Toggle ★ updates UI optimistically and keeps aria-labels accessible.
- Store optional prefs (`bbz:v1:prefs`) for filters/sorting.

### Detailed Plan – Favorites & Prefs Persistence
1. **Storage primitives**
   - Extend `constants.js` with keys for `favorites` and `prefs`.
   - In `storage.js`, add helpers: `normalizeFavoriteIds()`, `loadFavorites({ validIds })`, `saveFavorites(ids)`, `loadPrefs()`, `savePrefs(prefs)`.
   - Helpers must gracefully handle missing/blocked `localStorage`, returning `{ persistent:false }` when writes are unavailable (e.g., private mode).
2. **Bootstrap hydration**
   - After manifest/session bootstrap, hydrate favorites + prefs:
     - Build `Set` of valid manifest IDs, drop stale favorites, emit toast “Oppdaterte favoritter …” when trimming occurs.
     - Apply stored `filterFavoritesOnly` to `libraryState` + checkbox, defaulting to false.
3. **UI integration**
   - `toggleFavorite(id)` should update `favoritesSet`, re-render list, then `persistFavorites()`; show warning toast when persistence fails (“Favoritter lagres ikke …”).
   - Filter checkbox change should call `persistLibraryPrefs()` with current flag; warn if storage unavailable.
   - Status line should continue to show steady summary, with temporary toasts for warnings.
4. **Reset & fail-safe behavior**
   - Ensure favorites are cleared only when manifest demands it; session resets should not touch `favorites`.
   - Debug helpers (`window.bingoBuzzDebug`) can expose `storage.loadFavorites()` output for QA.

## 3. Regenerate Playlist (Favorites First)
- Button “Regenerer rekkefølge” (aria-label “Regenerer spillelisten med favoritter først”), disabled when manifest empty.
- On click: fade/stop current playback; compute `order = shuffle(favorites) + shuffle(nonFavorites)`.
- Persist via existing session keys: `playlistIds=order`, `index=0`, `createdAt=Date.now()`, keep `manifestEtag`.
- Update UI state to idle (`Klar · #1 av N gjenstår`), show toast “Ny rekkefølge generert: F favoritter + U øvrige”.
- Handle edge-cases (0/all favorites, storage blocked) gracefully.
- Expose `window.bingoBuzzDebug.regenByFavorites()` for QA.

### Detailed Plan – Regenerate Playlist (Steg 3)
1. **UI wiring**
   - Enable the “Regenerer rekkefølge” button whenever manifest has >0 filer; add aria-live toast region reuse (libraryStatus).
   - Bind click handler that:
     1. Closes preview audio.
     2. If main audio plays, awaits `audioEngine.fadeOut(STOP_FADE_MS)` before proceeding.
     3. Calls a new controller method `regenerateOrder({ reason: "manual" })`.
2. **Order construction**
   - Implement helper `buildFavoritesFirstOrder({ files, favorites })` inside `playlist.js` (or a playlist utility) that:
     - Accepts full manifest list + Set of favorite IDs.
     - Produces `order = shuffle(favorites∩files) + shuffle(nonFavorites)`, reusing existing Fisher–Yates shuffle.
     - Returns metadata `{ order, favoriteCount, restCount }`.
   - Ensure determinism for tests by reusing playlist’s RNG seed if available.
3. **Playlist + storage sync**
   - Add method `playlist.applyOrder(order)` that resets cursor to 0, updates internal order/index, and exposes snapshot.
   - In `app.js`, after computing the new order:
     - Update playlist via `applyOrder`.
     - Call `persistSession({ index:0, order })` with `createdAt: Date.now()` to reset TTL freshness while keeping manifestEtag.
     - Clear `lastPlayedId`/`audioEngine` state so next press starts from first track.
4. **UI feedback**
   - After regeneration, close library panel? (spec says panel remains open but primary button shows idle). Keep panel open but set status text: `Ny rekkefølge generert: F favoritter + U øvrige (totalt N)`.
   - Update main UI: `statusLine = Klar · #1 av ${playlist.size} gjenstår`, button label “Start neste”, `showReset=false`.
   - Disable button while fade/order building runs to prevent double-click.
5. **Edge cases**
   - No favorites: shuffle all once.
   - All favorites: still shuffle all once.
   - Empty manifest or playlist size 0: keep button disabled, show “Ingen klipp” toast.
   - Storage blocked: `persistSession` already no-ops but log warning; still update in-memory playlist so the session behaves for this visit.
6. **Debug hook & QA**
   - Add `window.bingoBuzzDebug.regenByFavorites()` that calls the same internal routine (skipping fade) for testing.
   - QA steps: mark favorites, regen, verify localStorage playlist order begins with favorites, `createdAt` updates, TTL resets, and next press plays new first clip.

## 4. Accessibility & QA
- Ensure panel focus management and aria-live updates for status/toasts.
- Validate that favorites persist across reloads and regen honors the priority.
- Confirm TTL resets after manual regen and that preview playback stays isolated.

# Implementation Plan: BingoBuzz PWA

## 1. Web App Manifest & Icons
- Create `/app.webmanifest` with full metadata (`name`, `short_name`, `start_url`, `scope`, `display`, `background_color`, `theme_color`).
- Reference existing icons or add 192×192 and 512×512 PNGs under `assets/icons/`.
- Update `index.html` `<head>` with:
  - `<link rel="manifest" href="/app.webmanifest">`
  - `<meta name="theme-color" content="#0a0818">`
  - Optional iOS tags (`apple-touch-icon`, `apple-mobile-web-app-capable`, status-bar style).

## 2. Service Worker
- Add `/sw.js` that:
  - Precaches the app shell (HTML, CSS, JS modules).
  - Uses cache-first for shell assets.
  - Uses stale-while-revalidate for audio under `/assets/sounds/` (cache on first play, no upfront bulk caching).
  - Cleans up old caches on `activate` (bump cache name on releases).
- Register the worker once in `assets/js/app.js` after bootstrap (`navigator.serviceWorker.register("/sw.js")` guarded by feature detection).

## 3. Offline Behavior & Testing
- Ensure fetch failures (e.g., manifest load) have graceful fallbacks when offline.
- Document how to clear caches and bump cache keys when deploying new shell versions.
- Update docs with a PWA section (requirements, testing with Lighthouse/Add to Home Screen).
- Manual QA checklist:
  - Install prompt visible on Chrome (desktop/mobile).
  - App loads offline with cached shell + any previously fetched audio.
  - Service worker updates after cache version bump.
# Detailed Plan: Bibliotekspanel (Steg 1)

## 1. Triggere & Åpning/Lukking
- **Hotspot**: Transparent knapp (64×64 px) øverst til høyre (`position:absolute`, `aria-label="Åpne bibliotek"`). 
- **Langt trykk**: Lytt på `touchstart/mousedown` og mål >600 ms før åpning; avbryt ved `touchend/mouseup`.
- **Tastatur**: Global `keydown` på `L` som toggler panelet (debounce når fokus i input).
- **Lukking**: ESC, klikk på overlay (utenfor panel), egen “Lukk”-knapp.

## 2. Modalstruktur & Fokus
- Overlay (`#library-overlay`) med `role="dialog"` og `aria-modal="true"`, `hidden` som toggles.
- Panel (`#library-panel`) kan være drawer eller kort; ved åpning:
  - lagre `lastFocusedElement`.
  - `hidden = false`, sett `focus()` på første element (f.eks. “Regenerer rekkefølge”).
  - Felle Tab/Shift+Tab slik at fokus ikke hopper ut (enkel focus trap).
- Ved lukking: `hidden = true`, returner fokus til `lastFocusedElement`.

## 3. Panelinnhold
- **Heading** + `aria-live="polite"` statusområde.
- **Regenerer-knapp** øverst (disabled hvis manifest tomt).
- **Filter**: checkbox/switch “Vis bare favoritter” (lagres via prefs).
- **Liste**:
  - Layout (liste eller tabell) med rader: tittel/id, kategori, previewknapp, ★-toggle.
  - Favoritter sorteres først (★), resten etter id; støtt filteret.
- **Forhåndslytt**:
  - Preview-knapp spiller/spanner via audio-engine i separat modus.
  - Stopp preview hvis hovedknappen startes eller annet preview aktiveres.

## 4. Tilstand & Data
- `libraryState = { isOpen, filterFavoritesOnly, previewClipId }`.
- Manifest + favorites brukes til å bygge radene; oppdater favoritt-knapp optimistisk.
- Implementér helper-funksjoner i `storage.js` for `loadFavorites/saveFavorites` (selv om lagring kommer i steg 2).

## 5. Tilgjengelighet
- Panel `aria-labelledby` → heading id.
- Status-meldinger (toast) sendes via `aria-live="polite"`.
- Alle knapper har `aria-label` (“Spill <id>”, “Merk som favoritt <id>”).
- Preferer semantiske elementer (`button`, `ul/li` eller `table`).

## 6. Sanitetssjekker før videre steg
- Åpne/lukke fungerer via alle triggere; fokus returneres korrekt.
- Preview fungerer uten å påvirke hovedknappen.
- Favoritt-knapper kan toggles (selv om lagring ikke er ferdig).
- Regenerer-knapp vises, men handling implementeres i neste steg.
- Ingen bibliotek-elementer synlige når panelet er lukket.

# BingoBuzz PWA Guide

## Install/Update Workflow
1. Ensure the icons in `assets/icons/` (192×192 & 512×512) match the latest branding.
2. Update `/app.webmanifest` if name/theme/colors change.
3. When modifying shell assets (HTML/CSS/JS), bump cache labels in `sw.js` (e.g. `bbz-shell-v3`, `bbz-audio-v3`).
4. Rebuild/serve the app, then reload twice to ensure the new service worker activates.

## Service Worker Testing
- `npm run dev` (or your static server) → open `http://localhost:PORT` → DevTools > Application > Service Workers.
- Confirm `sw.js` is “activated and is running”.
- Toggle “Offline” and reload: UI + any previously played audio should remain available.
- Clear caches by running `navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(regs => regs.forEach(r => r.unregister()))` in DevTools when debugging.

## Lighthouse Audit
Run a PWA audit after functional changes:
```bash
npx lighthouse http://localhost:PORT --preset=pwa --output html --output-path ./lighthouse-pwa.html
```
Check that:
- “Installable” and “PWA Optimized” sections pass.
- No blocking issues under Diagnostics.

## Manifest & App Icons
- Keep `app.webmanifest` at project root.
- Link it in `index.html` along with `<meta name="theme-color">` and iOS meta tags.
- Update `assets/icons/` when branding changes and keep PNGs optimized.

## Audio Caching Notes
- `sw.js` caches the app shell eagerly, but audio files only after the first successful fetch (“stale-while-revalidate”).
- Large sound packs should not be precached; let users stream them and rely on SW cache for replays.

## Release Checklist
- [ ] Increment cache names in `sw.js` after shell changes.
- [ ] Run `npm test`.
- [ ] Run Lighthouse PWA audit (`npx lighthouse ...`).
- [ ] Verify install prompt/Add to Home Screen.
- [ ] Commit regenerated `app.webmanifest`/icons if changed.

# BingoBuzz Implementation Roadmap

## 1. Project Scaffolding
- Init basic structure: `index.html`, `assets/css/style.css`, `assets/js/{app.js,audio-engine.js,playlist.js,storage.js,constants.js}`, `assets/sounds/bingobuzz/manifest.json`.
- Draft semantic markup with primary/secondary buttons and status region (`aria-live="polite"`).
- Establish shared constants (`SESSION_TTL_MS`, `STOP_FADE_MS`, `PREFETCH_AHEAD`, `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_SKIPS`).

## 2. Manifest & Storage Layer
- Define manifest schema with `formats`, `normalization`, per-file `durationHintMs`, `etag`, and top-level `manifestEtag`.
- Implement loader that fetches/validates manifest, falls back gracefully on fetch errors.
- Build `storage.js` with helpers:
  - `loadSession()`, `saveSession(sessionState)`, `clearSession()`.
  - `shouldReset({ manifestEtag, now })` factoring TTL (`SESSION_TTL_MS`), `?fresh=1`, and manifest mismatch.
  - Namespace localStorage keys `bbz:v1:{playlist,index,createdAt,manifestEtag}`.

## 3. Playlist Engine
- Implement `playlist.js` exposing:
  - `init(files, seed?)` (Fisher–Yates shuffle with optional seed).
  - `next()` returning `{ clip, done }`.
  - `peek()` without advancing cursor.
  - `reset()` to reshuffle and zero cursor.
  - `skipFailed(badId)` to advance past defective tracks (guard with `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_SKIPS`).
  - `isComplete()` for UI lockout.
- Ensure session state can serialize/restore `playlist` order and cursor index.

## 4. Audio Engine
- Use Web Audio API as primary path; lazy-initialize `AudioContext` on first trusted interaction.
- Implement `play(clipMeta)` returning a promise that resolves on start or rejects if `state !== idle`.
- Implement `fadeOut(duration = STOP_FADE_MS)` with gain ramp; no-op if already idle.
- Provide fallback `<audio>` element path when Web Audio unsupported; share contract semantics.
- Track readable `state` (`idle`, `playing`, `fading`, `error`) and emit hooks/events for UI updates.
- Prefetch next `PREFETCH_AHEAD` sources when feasible; respect `durationHintMs` to avoid heavy decode.

## 5. App Orchestration
- In `app.js`, bootstrap flow:
  - Fetch manifest, check `storage.shouldReset`, hydrate playlist/audio, restore UI state.
- Bind hovedknappen til en togglet flow: idle trykk → `playlist.next` + `audio.play`, playing trykk → `audio.fadeOut`.
  - Reflect state transitions in DOM (button `disabled`/`aria-disabled`, busy animations, status text).
  - Handle automatic reset when playlist complete (show “Start på nytt”), and manual reset action.
  - Integrate error handling: on playback failure call `playlist.skipFailed`, retry until `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_SKIPS`.
- Monitor TTL while page is open; on next interaction post-expiry, trigger full reset.

## 6. UI & Styling
- Craft `style.css` with CSS custom properties, layout, responsive sizing, and accessible focus rings.
- Implement busy/disabled/fade states using classes; add subtle animations with `prefers-reduced-motion` guards.
- Include iconography (optional) and ensure contrast ratios meet accessibility guidelines.

## 7. Testing & QA
- Manual acceptance checklist:
  - Shuffle invariant: full cycle plays each clip once.
  - TTL reset: manipulate `createdAt` to exceed 3h → next interaction reshuffles.
  - Busy guard: rapid clicks on “Start neste” during playback/fade cause no overlaps.
  - Format fallback: simulate failed WebM to confirm MP3 path.
  - Accessibility: keyboard activation, focus management, `aria-live` updates.
- (Future) Add lightweight unit tests for `playlist` logic and storage TTL math via simple test harness.

### Browser QA Playbook
- **Forberedelser**
  - Åpne developer tools (`F12`), behold `Console` og `Application > Storage > Local Storage`.
  - Tøm `localStorage` (`localStorage.clear()`) før første test for ren tilstand.
  - Bekreft at manifestet laster (ingen røde feil i konsollen).
  - Debug-verktøy er tilgjengelig via `window.bingoBuzzDebug`: `bingoBuzzDebug.getState()`, `bingoBuzzDebug.playlist.snapshot()`, etc.

- **Standard flyt**
  - Første trykk på hovedknappen (`Start neste`) skal starte lyd og oppdatere label til `Fade ut`.
  - Vent til avspillingen stopper av seg selv; knappen skal gå tilbake til `Start neste` og status vise `Klar · #2 av N gjenstår`.
  - Gjenta for minst tre klipp, og sjekk at `localStorage`-feltene (`bbz:v1:*`) oppdateres etter hvert spor.

- **Fade-test**
  - Start et klipp og trykk knappen igjen (den viser `Fade ut`). Lyd skal fade innen ~1.2 s og status gå `Fader ut …` → `Klar …`.
  - Etter fade skal knappen automatisk vise `Start neste` og være klar for neste trykk.

- **Busy-guard**
  - Klikk knappen gjentatte ganger mens et klipp spiller; første ekstra trykk skal trigge fade, senere klikk under fade skal ignoreres (kort `is-busy`-puls, ingen feil).
  - Etter fade, bekreft at neste trykk starter neste klipp umiddelbart.

- **Full syklus + auto-reset**
  - Spill gjennom alle klipp (evt. i testmodus: kjør `bingoBuzzDebug.resetPlaylist()` i konsollen og bruk `bingoBuzzDebug.playlist.snapshot()` for fremdrift).
  - Når siste klipp er ferdig, status skal vise `Alt spilt i denne økta · Start på nytt`, og knappen skal vise `Alt spilt` (deaktivert).
  - Klikk "Start på nytt"; bekreft at knappen viser `Start neste`, ny rekkefølge genereres og `localStorage` får nytt `createdAt`.
  - Verifiser med `bingoBuzzDebug.getState()` for full oversikt over tilstand.

- **TTL / fresh flag**
  - I devtools, sett `bbz:v1:createdAt` til en verdi >3 timer tilbake (`Date.now() - 3.5*60*60*1000`).
  - Reload siden, trykk “Start neste”; forvent at køen reshuffles (sjekk `playlistIds` endres) og status er “Klar …”.
  - Test `?fresh=1` ved å laste `index.html?fresh=1`; bekreft automatisk reset.

- **Feilhåndtering / skip**
  - Midlertidig gi én fil feil navn (f.eks. endre i filsystemet til `*.bak`) og reload.
  - Trykk “Start neste”; når filen nås, status skal vise “Hoppet over en fil · prøver neste …” og neste klipp skal starte.
  - Revert filnavnet etter verifikasjon.

- **Tilgjengelighet**
  - Naviger med `Tab` til hovedknappen; fokusring skal være tydelig.
  - Bruk `Space`/`Enter`; første aktivering starter lyd, andre aktiverer fade.
  - I Console: `document.querySelector('#status-line').getAttribute('role')` → skal være `status`; observer `aria-live` ved avspillingsendringer.

- **Persistens på tvers av reload**
  - Spill ett klipp, reload siden (uten å cleare storage); status skal vise neste indeks (`#2 av N gjenstår`).
  - Bekreft at knappen viser `Start neste` etter reload og starter neste klipp uten repetisjon.

- **Mobilrespons (valgfritt)**
  - Aktiver device toolbar i devtools (f.eks. iPhone 12). Knappene skal fortsatt være fullt brede, fokus og status lesbare.
  - Test tapping for play/fade; se etter utilsiktet zoom eller layout-skift.

## 9. Bibliotek, Favoritter og Re-generering (kommende)
- **Bibliotek/innstillingspanel**
  - Skjult panel (hotspot øverst, langt-trykk, tastatur `L`) med modal overlay; fokus flyttes inn/ut på åpne/lukk.
  - Viser manifest-listen med kolonner: tittel/id, kategori, preview-knapp, favoritt-toggle (★). Standard sortering: favoritter først, resten alfabetisk; filter “Vis bare favoritter”.
  - Preview spiller via audio-engine i separat modus; stoppes hvis hovedknappen aktiveres.

- **Favoritter**
  - Lagres i `localStorage` som `bbz:v1:favorites` (ingen TTL); valgfri pref-lagring `bbz:v1:prefs`.
  - Helper-funksjoner: `loadFavorites`, `saveFavorites`, `loadPrefs`, `savePrefs`.
  - Ugyldige IDer fjernes ved manifest-endring; lokal melding: “Favoritter lagres ikke (privatmodus aktiv)” hvis storage utilgjengelig.

- **Regenerer rekkefølge**
  - Knapp i biblioteket (`aria-label="Regenerer spillelisten med favoritter først"`), disabled når manifest er tomt.
  - Handling: fade/stop hovedavspilling → bygg order = shuffle(favorites) + shuffle(nonFavorites) → `playlistIds=order`, `index=0`, `createdAt=Date.now()`, behold `manifestEtag`.
  - Vis toast/inline melding “Ny rekkefølge generert: F favoritter + U øvrige”.
  - Edge-cases: 0/alle favoritter → gjelder fortsatt; fallback i minne hvis storage blokkeres.

- **Tilgjengelighet**
  - Panel `role="dialog" aria-modal="true"`; alle knapper med aria-labels; status/feedback via `aria-live="polite"`.

- **QA-kriterier**
  - Favoritter beholdes ved reload; regen gir favoritter først.
  - `createdAt` oppdateres; auto-reset ikke trigget umiddelbart.
  - Preview vs hovedavspilling isoleres; ingen bibliotek-elementer på hovedskjermen.

- **Debug**
  - `window.bingoBuzzDebug.regenByFavorites()` trigger samme logikk for test.

## 8. Future Enhancements (Backlog)
- Volume slider and fade-length options persisted via storage.
- Offline caching with Service Worker and versioned assets.
- Multi-tab coordination via `BroadcastChannel`.
- Telemetry/logging hooks for monitoring playback errors.
